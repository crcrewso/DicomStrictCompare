        Welcome to the Dicom Dose Batch Comparison Utility.
        Expects  - Two folders, each filled with dicom dose files from the same patient,
                - The expected difference is that they were in some way calculated differently
        Each of the following folders can have subfolders, they don't need to match layout.
        Source - The set of Files you Trust
        Target - The set of Files you want to determine how different they are from source
Save - Directory you want to save the results, CSV will be saved to this directory 
         - PDD comparison plots will be saved into indexed subdirectories
Save Name - Save Name of the csv file containing the summary information.
 
DTA Definitions:
Tolerance    - Percent Deviation of Target dose at each point to pass agreement
DTA            - Distance to agreement in units of mm or voxels, can be 0
Threshhold - Percent of Max source below which comparisons will not be made
Trim           - Allows the user to remove a number of skin voxels from the phantom
                    Useful if there is a known discrepancy in skin dose between two algorithims
                    that the user would like to remove from analysis
Gamma     - if Checked a gamma calculation will be used for comparison, 
                    if not software defaults to dta 
Global       - Tolerance difference is percent of peak dose
Local         - Tolerance difference is percent of source
